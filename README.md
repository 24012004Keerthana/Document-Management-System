The Document Management System (DMS) is a web-based project that facilitates basic document management operations through a simple and intuitive interface. Built with Java Server Pages (JSP), HTML/CSS, and MySQL, this system allows users to seamlessly add, view, and delete document records.The DMS is designed to handle essential document management tasks in a structured manner. Users can input details such as document ID, name, type (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel), and description, which are then securely stored in the database. The system also provides a tabular view of all stored records and enables the deletion of specific entries by their unique IDs.This project is an ideal introduction to integrating web development with database management. Its lightweight architecture makes it suitable for educational purposes, small-scale applications, or as a foundation for more advanced systems. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the DMS is a practical demonstration of CRUD operations in a web-based environment.
